Here's a breakdown of each section of the code:

1. **Importing Libraries**:
   ```python
   import cv2
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   ```
   - **cv2**: OpenCV library for image processing.
   - **numpy**: Library for numerical operations.
   - **matplotlib.pyplot**: Used to display images.

2. **Loading the YOLOv3 Model**:
   ```python
   yolo = cv2.dnn.readNet('./yolov3.weights', './yolov3.cfg')
   ```
   - Loads the pre-trained YOLOv3 model using its weights and configuration file. This model is used for object detection.

3. **Loading Class Labels**:
   ```python
   classes = []
   with open('./coco.names','r') as namefile:
     classes = namefile.read().splitlines()
   ```
   - Loads the class labels (e.g., person, car, etc.) from the `coco.names` file into a list called `classes`.

4. **Getting Image Path from User**:
   ```python
   image_path = input("Path of IMAGE you want to detect object?(./filename.jpg)")
   ```
   - Prompts the user to input the path of the image on which object detection will be performed.

5. **Reading the Image**:
   ```python
   img = cv2.imread(image_path)
   ```
   - Reads the image from the provided path using OpenCV's `imread` function.

6. **Creating a Blob from the Image**:
   ```python
   blob = cv2.dnn.blobFromImage(img, 1/255, (320,320), (0,0,0), swapRB=True, crop=False)
   ```
   - Converts the image into a blob, which is a preprocessed version of the image. It normalizes the pixel values and resizes the image to 320x320 pixels, as required by the YOLOv3 model.

7. **Displaying the Blob**:
   ```python
   i = blob[0].reshape(320, 320, 3)
   plt.imshow(i)
   ```
   - Reshapes and displays the blob image using Matplotlib to visualize what the model sees.

8. **Feeding the Blob to the YOLOv3 Model**:
   ```python
   yolo.setInput(blob)
   ```
   - Feeds the preprocessed image (blob) into the YOLO model.

9. **Getting Output Layer Names**:
   ```python
   output_layer_name = yolo.getUnconnectedOutLayersNames()
   ```
   - Retrieves the names of the output layers, which will be used to extract the detection results from the model.

10. **Forward Pass to Get Detections**:
    ```python
    layeroutput = yolo.forward(output_layer_name)
    ```
    - Performs a forward pass through the network to get the output from the detection layers.

11. **Initializing Lists for Detections**:
    ```python
    boxes = []
    confidences = []
    class_ids = []
    ```
    - Initializes empty lists to store bounding boxes, confidence scores, and class IDs for detected objects.

12. **Processing Detections**:
    ```python
    height, width, _ = blob[0].shape

    for output in layeroutput:
      for detection in output:
        score = detection[5:]
        class_id = np.argmax(score)
        confidence = score[class_id]
        if confidence > 0.7:
          center_x = int(detection[0]*width)
          center_y = int(detection[1]*height)
          w = int(detection[2]*width)
          h = int(detection[3]*height)

          x = int(center_x - w/2)
          y = int(center_y - h/2)

          boxes.append([x,y,w,h])
          confidences.append((float(confidence)))
          class_ids.append(class_id)
    ```
    - Iterates through the detections, calculates the bounding box coordinates, confidence scores, and class IDs. Only detections with confidence higher than 0.7 are considered.

13. **Applying Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)**:
    ```python
    indexes = cv2.dnn.NMSBoxes(boxes, confidences, 0.5, 0.4)
    ```
    - Applies NMS to eliminate redundant overlapping boxes with lower confidence scores, retaining the most accurate bounding boxes.

14. **Drawing Bounding Boxes and Labels on Image**:
    ```python
    font = cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_PLAIN
    colors = np.random.uniform(0, 255, size=(len(boxes), 3))

    for i in indexes.flatten():
      x,y,w,h = boxes[i]
      label = str(classes[class_ids[i]])
      confidence = str(round(confidences[i], 2))
      color = colors[i]
      cv2.rectangle(img, (x,y), (x+w, y+h), color, 2)
      cv2.putText(img, label + " " + confidence, (x, y+20), font, 2, (255,255,255), 2)
    ```
    - For each detection, draws a bounding box around the detected object and labels it with the class name and confidence score.

15. **Displaying the Final Image**:
    ```python
    plt.imshow(img)
    ```
    - Displays the final image with bounding boxes and labels using Matplotlib.
